# Reinforcement-Learning
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful area of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment. RL is based on trial and error, using rewards as feedback to improve its decision-making.

# Key terms
Agent: The learner that takes actions in the environment.

Environment: The world where the agent interacts.

State (s): A representation of the current situation.

Action (a): The set of possible actions the agent can take.

Reward (R): A scalar feedback signal that tells the agent how good or bad its action was.

Policy (π): A strategy that maps states to actions.

Value Function (V): Measures how good a state is.

Markov Decision Process (MDP)

A Markov Decision Process is a mathematical framework used to model decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker. MDPs are fundamental to reinforcement learning as they provide a formal way to model the interaction between an agent and its environment13.
Key Components of an MDP

    States (S): The set of all possible situations in the environment.

    Actions (A): The set of all possible actions an agent can take.

    Transition Function (P): Defines the probability of transitioning from one state to another given an action.

    Reward Function (R): Specifies the immediate reward received after taking an action in a state.

    Discount Factor (γ): A value between 0 and 1 that determines the importance of future rewards.

Mathematical Formulation

Let's break down the mathematical representation of an MDP:

    State Transition Probability:
    P(s′∣s,a)=Pr(St+1=s′∣St=s,At=a)P(s′∣s,a)=Pr(St+1=s′∣St=s,At=a)

    This equation represents the probability of transitioning to state s' given that the current state is s and action a is taken. It captures the dynamics of the environment1.

    Reward Function:
    R(s,a,s′)=E[Rt+1∣St=s,At=a,St+1=s′]R(s,a,s′)=E[Rt+1∣St=s,At=a,St+1=s′]

    This function defines the expected immediate reward received after taking action a in state s and transitioning to state s'. It quantifies the desirability of a particular state-action-next state combination1.

    Policy:
    π(a∣s)=Pr(At=a∣St=s)π(a∣s)=Pr(At=a∣St=s)

    A policy is a strategy that the agent follows to determine the next action based on the current state. It can be deterministic or stochastic1.

    Value Function:
    Vπ(s)=Eπ[∑k=0∞γkRt+k+1∣St=s]Vπ(s)=Eπ[∑k=0∞γkRt+k+1∣St=s]

    The value function represents the expected cumulative reward when starting from state s and following policy π. It helps in evaluating how good it is to be in a particular state1.

    Q-Function (Action-Value Function):
    Qπ(s,a)=Eπ[∑k=0∞γkRt+k+1∣St=s,At=a]Qπ(s,a)=Eπ[∑k=0∞γkRt+k+1∣St=s,At=a]

    The Q-function represents the expected cumulative reward when taking action a in state s and then following policy π. It helps in evaluating the quality of state-action pairs1.

    Bellman Equation for V:
    Vπ(s)=∑aπ(a∣s)∑s′P(s′∣s,a)[R(s,a,s′)+γVπ(s′)]Vπ(s)=∑aπ(a∣s)∑s′P(s′∣s,a)[R(s,a,s′)+γVπ(s′)]

    This equation expresses the value of a state in terms of the immediate reward and the discounted value of the next state. It forms the basis for many reinforcement learning algorithms1.

    Bellman Equation for Q:
    Qπ(s,a)=∑s′P(s′∣s,a)[R(s,a,s′)+γ∑a′π(a′∣s′)Qπ(s′,a′)]Qπ(s,a)=∑s′P(s′∣s,a)[R(s,a,s′)+γ∑a′π(a′∣s′)Qπ(s′,a′)]

    Similar to the Bellman equation for V, this equation expresses the Q-value of a state-action pair in terms of immediate reward and future Q-values1.
