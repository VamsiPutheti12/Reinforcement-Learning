# Reinforcement-Learning
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful area of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment. RL is based on trial and error, using rewards as feedback to improve its decision-making.

# Key terms

Environment: The world where the agent interacts.

State (s): A representation of the current situation.
